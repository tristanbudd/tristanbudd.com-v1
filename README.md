# Personal Website V1

This is my first take at making a personal portfolio / general purpose hub for links. I made sure to attempt to include some nice features as well as a space theme with Sci-fi looking fonts, graphics and visuals.
I think I gave it a good shot and the code is kept neat if you want to borrow any elements from it. 

## Features

- **Section Scrollers:** On most modern phones and screen sizes, the page will scroll by section instead of manually with indicators to quickly navigate the site.
- **Automations:** There is a working clock and age calculator on the site that function with JavaScript.
- **Github API:** The pages last updated time is noted at the top of the page (only visible on larger screens).
